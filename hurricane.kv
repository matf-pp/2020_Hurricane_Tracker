Fifteen out of twenty-seven storms attained hurricane status, and seven of those became major hurricanes (category 3 or higher).\nThis hurricane season made a catastrophic impact, with nearly 4,000 deaths and approximately $171 billion in damage. It lasted from June 2005 to January 2006, mainly devastating the Gulf Coast of the United States.\n\nThe strongest hurricanes were Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Four of them reached category 5, which is the highest ranking on the scale.\nChoose one of them to see its path being animated."
